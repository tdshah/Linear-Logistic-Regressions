# Linear-Logistic-Regressions
Utilized the UCI Machine Learning dataset to create:

a) linear regressions with various regularizers and a Box Cox transformation
b) logistic regression for classifiying whether or not a credit card defaults

For the regularization techniques, performed Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net Regression for both linear & logistic regressions
